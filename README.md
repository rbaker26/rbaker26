### Hi there,  👋
I am a Software Engineer who loves to learn new things and push myself to create meaningful projects.

My current project is the __SAP1Emu Project__, an 8-bit computer emulator built for __Saddleback College's Computer Science Department__.  Its goal is to help with online learning due to the COVID-19 crisis.  It is built on a __C# / .NET Core 3.1 / ASP.NET Core / Electron.NET__ stack.  Check out its [Wiki Page](https://github.com/rbaker26/SAP1EMU/wiki) for more information.
