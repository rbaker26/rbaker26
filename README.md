### Hi there,  ðŸ‘‹
I am a Software Engineer who loves to learn new things and push myself to create meaningful projects.

My current Project is the SAP1Emu Project, an 8-bit computer emulator build for Saddleback College's Computer Science Department.  Its goal is to help with online learning due to the COVID-19 crisis.  It is built on a C# / .NET Core 3.1 / ASP.NET Core / Electron.NET stack.  Check out its [Wiki Page](https://github.com/rbaker26/SAP1EMU/wiki) for more information.
