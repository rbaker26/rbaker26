### Hi there,  👋
I am a Software Engineer who loves to learn new things and push myself to create meaningful projects.

My current Project is the SAP1Emu Project, an 8-bit computer emulator build for Saddleback College's Computer Science Department.  Its goal is to help with online learning due to the COVID-19 crisis.
